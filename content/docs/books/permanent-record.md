# Permanent Record - Edward Snowden

## Review
An insightful look into the mind of a whistleblower. Regardless of your political opinion, I think it’s hard to underestimate Snowden. He’s cunning, down-to-earth, and caring. This is also a truly mind-bending look at the guts of the American (and in some ways global) intelligence community. It’s like looking at a slaughterhouse right before eating a steak. And by that I mean it made me gag when I saw the innards of intelligence. I won’t jump into political opinions here but suffice it to say this book is an interesting read regardless of whether you use it as ammo against Snowden or against the government.
