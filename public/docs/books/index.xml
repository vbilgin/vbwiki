      <description>Facebook - Steven Levy #  Review #  I enjoyed this book and would recommend it if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for any of the below:
 An in-depth look at Facebook from the beginning until ~2019 An in-depth look at Mark Zuckerberg An understanding of how Facebook operates as an organization and a business  In terms of the writing, I felt like Levy jumped around chronologically to the point of confusion in certain chapters.</description>

      <description>Permanent Record - Edward Snowden #  Review #  An insightful look into the mind of a whistleblower. Regardless of your political opinion, I think it’s hard to underestimate Snowden. He’s cunning, down-to-earth, and caring. This is also a truly mind-bending look at the guts of the American (and in some ways global) intelligence community. It’s like looking at a slaughterhouse right before eating a steak. And by that I mean it made me gag when I saw the innards of intelligence.</description>
